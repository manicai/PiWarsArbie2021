# PiWarsArbie2021
Team Arbie code for Pi Wars 2021

Team blog: http://piwarsarbie.wordpress.com

Caveats:

 - This code is designed to run on precisely one computer. The Raspberry Pi 3 running our robot for Pi Wars 2021. Because of this it's not like everything is controllable with nice well documented configuration options - stuff that I don't expect to change is probably hard coded.
 
 - The status webserver is accessible on a home network with maybe two clients connecting to it. Don't expect it to be secure or designed for load. :-)
